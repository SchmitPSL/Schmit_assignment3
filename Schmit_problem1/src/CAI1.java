/*
 * The program shall generate random numbers with a SecureRandom object
The program shall ask the student to solve a multiplication problem
A multiplication problem shall contain two numbers sampled from a uniform random distribution in the range of 0 to 9 (inclusive)
The program shall display the message "Very good!" if the student provides a correct response
The program shall display the message "No. Please try again." if the student provides an incorrect response
The program shall terminate when a correct response is provided by the student
The program shall continue to ask the student to solve the original multiplication problem until the student provides the correct answer
Create a method called "quiz" that contains the program logic
Create a method called "askQuestion" that prints the problem to the screen
Create a method called "readResponse" that reads the answer from the student
Create a method called "isAsnwerCorrect" that checks to see if the student's answer matches the correct answer to the problem
Create a method called "displayCorrectResponse" that prints out the response when a student enters a correct answer
Create a method called "displayInorrectResponse" that prints out the response when a student enters an incorrect answer
Create a main method that runs your program by calling the "quiz" method
