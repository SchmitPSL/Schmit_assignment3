 * Write a program called SavingsAccountTest to test class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two SavingsAccount objects, saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set annualInterestRate to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest for each of 12 months and print the monthly balances for both savers. Next, set the annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the next month’s interest and print the new balances for both savers.
